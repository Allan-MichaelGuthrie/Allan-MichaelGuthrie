<h1>Hi, I'm Allan-Michael Guthrie! </h1>
I'm a Information Technology professional that is breaking into Network Security/ Cyber Security. I am not only building the framework but also responsible for securing network traffic. My goal is to stop the threat before it gets to the door or improving the wall throught pentesting. I have been working for about 4 years now not counting my projects on the side. I worked in his current position as a Distributed Computer Systems Analyst (Jr. Network Admin), for over2 years and during this time Allan-Michael obtained a better knowledge base with Firewalls by using Palo Alto to block and unblock website by see if the certain policy are blocking or not, and with cloud technologie were he have use Azure to reset MFA and troubleshooting external user account when they don't work,and with investigating skill where he is given a project or ticket to deal with trying to see if website need to be block or software where it's not working correctly and no one else on my team know so I get contact with the vendor to look further in to it or my manager telling him to go found out if it is possibly to set up encryption on the client side. I has been a great asset and friend to my manager by providing solutions to troubleshoot issues for agency executives. Allan-Michael also enhanced team performance by taking on big project were i might know it but will to learn it and documenting and implementing process to by past to the rest of my team. Currently, I am in the process of getting my PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester). I also took some Black Hill Information Security programs. I am self-taught as well as have my AA degree. I am using Udemy courses, Tryhackme and Youtube to study. I believe you should never stop learning and to stay hungry.When you want to work with an I.T professional you can reach him at
