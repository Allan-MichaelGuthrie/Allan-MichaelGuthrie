<h1>Hi, I'm Allan-Michael Guthrie! </h1>
I'm a Information Technology professional that is breaking into Network Security/ Cyber Security. I am not only building the framework but also responsible for securing network traffic. My goal is to stop the threat before it gets to the door or improving the wall throught pentesting.  Currently, I am in the process of getting my PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester). I also took some Black Hill Information Security programs. I am self-taught as well as have my AA degree. I am using Udemy courses, Tryhackme and Youtube to study. I believe you should never stop learning and to stay hungry.When you want to work with an I.T professional you can reach him at
